## 📖 Overview

The **Solana KYC Compliance SDK** provides a robust framework for RWA (Real-World Asset) issuers and DeFi protocols to enforce regulatory compliance. By leveraging **Solana Token Extensions (Token-2022)**, this SDK allows for program-level validation of every token transfer without requiring centralized middleman intervention for every trade.

### Key Features
* **Transfer Hook Integration:** Automatically intercept and validate transfers against an on-chain identity registry.
* **Permanent Delegate Support:** Advanced recovery and administrative controls for compliant asset management.
* **On-Chain Registry:** A decentralized, versioned registry of KYC providers and AML rule sets.
* **Institutional Ready:** Designed for RWA issuance, security tokens, and governed stablecoins.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The SDK is composed of three primary layers:

1.  **On-Chain Program (Rust/Anchor):** The logic governing the Transfer Hook and validation of identity metadata.
2.  **Compliance Registry:** A public, versioned directory of trusted KYC/AML providers.
3.  **TypeScript SDK:** A high-level library for frontend and backend integration to mint, burn, and manage compliant tokens.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) & [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
* [Anchor Framework](https://www.anchor-lang.com/)
* [Node.js / Yarn](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/gitdigital-products/solana-kyc-compliance-sdk.git](https://github.com/gitdigital-products/solana-kyc-compliance-sdk.git)
```
# Install dependencies
cd solana-kyc-compliance-sdk
yarn install

Building the Program
anchor build

🛠️ Usage
1. Initialize a Compliant Mint
Use the SDK to create a token mint with the Transfer Hook extension enabled.
import { ComplianceSDK } from '@gitdigital/solana-kyc-sdk';

const sdk = new ComplianceSDK(connection, wallet);
const mint = await sdk.createCompliantMint({
    name: "Regulated RWA Token",
    symbol: "RWA",
    decimals: 6,
    authority: wallet.publicKey
});

2. Validating Transfers
The Transfer Hook automatically checks if the source and destination accounts have the required KYC flags in the registry. If the user is not verified, the transaction fails at the runtime level.
📊 Compliance Flow
 * Identity Verification: User completes KYC via a supported provider.
 * On-Chain Attestation: Provider signs an identity account for the user's wallet.
 * Transfer Check: * Sender initiates transfer.
   * TransferHook program is triggered.
   * Program queries the Compliance Registry.
   * Transfer is Approved or Denied.

### Key Enhancements Made:

1.  **Badge Wall:** Added high-visibility shields for License, Solana Version, Rust, TypeScript, and Contribution status using the "for-the-badge" style.
2.  **Value Proposition:** Explicitly mentioned **RWA (Real-World Assets)** and **Token Extensions**, as these are the biggest search/interest drivers for Solana compliance currently.
3.  **Code Snippets:** Included a hypothetical TypeScript usage block to show how easy it is for developers to integrate.
4.  **Visual Hierarchy:** Used dividers, emojis, and clear headers to make the documentation scannable.

      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

      defend, and hold harmless each Contributor for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## 🧪 Examples & Testing

This SDK provides practical examples and a comprehensive test suite to help you integrate KYC compliance into your Solana applications quickly.

### Example Integrations
~~
**1. Circle API Integration (`/examples/circle-api-integration.ts`)**
This example demonstrates a **KYC-gated USDC transfer** using Circle's Programmable Wallets API. It shows the complete flow:
- Verifying a sender's KYC status via the Solana Attestation Service (SAS).
- Generating an optional privacy-preserving Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP).
- Creating a compliant USDC transfer request with KYC metadata attached.

**Run the Example:**
`bash
# 1. Set your environment variables
export CIRCLE_API_KEY="your_circle_api_key_here"
export SOLANA_RPC_URL="https://api.devnet.solana.com"

# 2. Navigate to the example and install dependencies if needed
cd examples
npm install tsx dotenv @solana/web3.js

# 3. Run the example (update the wallet addresses and IDs in the code first)
npx tsx circle-api-integration.ts
🧪 Test Suite

We provide a robust test suite to ensure the reliability of the SDK's core functions.

Test Structure:

· /test/kyc-integration.test.ts: End-to-end integration tests for the main KYC verification flows and business logic.
· /test/sas-integration.test.ts: Low-level unit tests for the Solana Attestation Service (SAS) wrapper functions (schema registration, attestation lifecycle).
· /test/zk-proofs.test.ts: Cryptographic tests for the Zero-Knowledge Proof generation and verification components.
`
Running the Tests:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have a Solana Devnet RPC URL and may need a funded keypair for tests that create on-chain attestations.
Install Dependencies: npm install in the root directory (installs Jest, @solana/web3.js, etc.).
`Execute:
# Run all tests
npm test
 
# Run a specific test suite
npm test -- kyc-integration.test.ts
 
# Run tests with detailed output
npm test -- --verbose
Testing Strategy:

· Isolation: Unit tests mock external dependencies where possible.
· Coverage: Integration tests use Solana Devnet for real SAS interactions.
· Privacy: ZK proof tests use simulated circuits to validate cryptographic logic without needing a full prover setup.
